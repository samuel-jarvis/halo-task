## Tech Used
* React Js V18
* React Router v6
* Firebase v8
* SASS
* React Icons Package

## Lessons Learned
This is my first React Js Project.
* I solidified my understanding of the useState, useEffect and useRef Hook. 
* This project helped me to understand  how to pass data and funtions throught functional components.
* Handling Global context with Context API.
* Using icons in react
* Authentication and Storage with firease

## Future Release
I would love to restructure the CSS and add some animations to the UI. Some implementations i carried out felt hacky and I think there may be better ways of doing them.
Adding charts to track and visualize the summary of users tasks would also be nice on a seperate profile page.
